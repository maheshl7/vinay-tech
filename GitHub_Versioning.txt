GitHub Versioning

a) If you are confident about document you are uploading, directly do it in the master.
    So that that document versioning maintained.
   Incase you are not confident / most of the IT companies not allowing directly to maintain versioning. So, we need to follow the below process.
 1. Create a branch called Test
 2. Upload the modified document
 3. Create a pull request
 4. Merge the pulled request
 5. Automatically Test branch will be deleted.

Note: This versioning is close to TFS [Team Foundation Server] versioning.
